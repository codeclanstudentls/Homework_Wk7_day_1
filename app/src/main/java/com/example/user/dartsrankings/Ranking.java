// I thought the above loop would populate the array with rankings
// up to the length of the array (10) but I know its not right because it's a loop
// for populating an array with integers.  I thought rankings were int though? I so confused!!

/// is there not some sort of .index method I can do
// to find a player ranking at an index in the array?
